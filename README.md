Docker Solution
Dockerize the Spring Boot application.
Provide a Dockerfile for building the Docker image.
Include necessary configuration for the Docker container.
Technical Requirements
Technology Stack
Java
Spring Boot
H2 Database (for simplicity, can be replaced with other databases like PostgreSQL)
Docker Integration
Dockerize the Spring Boot application.
Provide Dockerfile for building the Docker image.
Include necessary configuration for the Docker container.
Project Structure
Follow a clean project structure, separating concerns appropriately (e.g., controllers, services, repositories).
Testing
Write unit tests for critical components using JUnit and/or TestNG.
Include integration tests for the API endpoints.
Documentation
Include clear and concise documentation for setting up and running the project.
Provide details on the API endpoints, request/response formats, and Docker deployment.
Running the Application
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd project-directory
Build the Docker image: docker build -t institute-management-system .
Run the Docker container: docker run -p 8080:8080 institute-management-system
The application should now be running and accessible at http://localhost:8080.
