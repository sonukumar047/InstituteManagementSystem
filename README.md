# Institute Management System API with Docker Support

This project implements a RESTful API for an Institute Management System using Java and Spring Boot. The API allows for the registration, modification, and retrieval of institute information. Additionally, it provides Docker support for easy deployment.

## Functional Requirements

**Institute Registration:**
- Endpoint for registering an institute with fields for name, location, contact information, and additional details.
- Secure storage of institute data.

**Institute Modification:**
- Endpoint for modifying institute information based on the institute's ID.
- Allow changes to fields such as name, location, and contact information.

**Institute Information Retrieval:**
- Endpoint to retrieve information about a specific institute based on the institute's ID.

**Docker Solution:**
- Dockerize the Spring Boot application.
- Provide a Dockerfile for building the Docker image.
- Include necessary configuration for the Docker container.

**Security Measures:**
- Implement proper input validation.
- Protect against common security threats
- Use HTTPS to secure communication.

## Technical Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Java and Spring Boot for development.
- MySQL for storing institute information.

**Docker Integration:**
- Docker solution for the Spring Boot application.
- Easy deployment using Docker.

**Project Structure:**
- Clean project structure with separation of concerns (e.g., controllers, services, repositories).

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for critical components using JUnit.
- Integration tests for the API endpoints.

**Documentation:**
- Clear documentation for setting up and running the project.
- Details on API endpoints, request/response formats, and Docker deployment.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main components:

1. **Controllers:**
   - `FacultyController`, `InstituteController`, and `StudentController` for handling API endpoints related to faculties, institutes, and students, respectively.

2. **Services:**
   - `FacultyService`, `InstituteService`, and `StudentService` for implementing business logic.

3. **Models:**
   - `Faculty`, `Institute`, and `Student` classes for defining the data structures.

## Running the Application

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/institute-management-system.git
